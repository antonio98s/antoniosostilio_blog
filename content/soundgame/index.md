excerpt: I created a game where touching any key on the keyboard creates sound and animation.  
---
## Objective

In this project, I wanted to learn more about how animations work.

## Process

The screen at first appears to be black, but if the user touches any letter on the keyboard, a musical sound be played and animation will pop up on the screen. Touching multiple letter keys will create an array of playful sounds and animations.
The animations are generated using a JavaScript library called paper.JS. 

## Results

I learned more about JavaScript libraries and their role in UI/UX development. Check out the game [`here`](https://antonio98s.github.io/sound-game/)
