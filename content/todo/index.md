## Objective

Anyone can use a to-do list! Whether it is for school, work, or buying groceries, to-lists help the user remember to accomplish their tasks. In this project, I created a to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Process

A new to-List must be empty and have a field to type the assigned task and add it to the list. Also, once the task is complete, it must be indicated. Lastly, tasks can also be deleted.

In order to fulfill these needs, I created a field where users can add a task. Then, once the user completes the task, the user can tap on the current task. A line will strike through, indicating that the task is done. To delete the task, the user can simply hover over the task and hit the trash can symbol for deletion.

## Results

We now have a completed to-list along with a gradient background! Check it out [`here`](https://antonio98s.github.io/to-do-list/).
