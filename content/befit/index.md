## Objective

In this project, I want to demonstrate that I am capable of designing a landing page for a fitness center. Creating this landing page will help potential members learn more about the gym and sign up after browsing the site. The potential customer will learn more about BeFit's services, personal coaches, pricing, and its flexible hours.

## Process

Before designing the site, I already had an idea on how to get started. I wanted this site to be similar to a gym that I frequently attend called [`Title Boxing Club`](https://titleboxingclub.com/). Observing the site helped me understand how to structure BeFit's site.

First, I created a logo using [`Logo Mkr`](https://logomakr.com/), which can be found online. Afterwards, I researched some images that would refect the type of site being designed. This included images of men and women excerising in fitness attire. 

Once I gathered the logo and images, I built the actual site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This involved from configuring the navigation bar to adding animation to the website images.

## Results

The design process led to an eye-catching landing page where current and potential customers can read about BeFit and what it has to offer. Check it out [`here`](https://antonio98s.github.io/befit.github.io/).
