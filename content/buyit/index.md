## Objective

In this project, I designed the home page of an ecommerce website as well as page of a sample product. I also did this project to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

## Process

First, I gather the images and icons that I will use throughout the web project. Then, I begin working on the nav and search bar at the top of the site followed by the carousel of images. Scrolling down, I created a Sales and New Arrivals section since ecommerce sites such as Amazon, WayFair, Overstock, etc contain simliar field. 

Lastly, I decided to work on developing a page for one of the displayed products. In this case, I worked on the Women's T-Shirts product where I included fields such as Pricing, Rating, Availability, Condition, Brand, Quantity, and Description. Once I added these important fields found in almost every ecommerce site, I styled the page with css. Check out the finished product [`here`](https://antonio98s.github.io/ecommerce-site/product.html)

## Results

The entire process led to a complete main page for the BuyIt ecommerce site. Something that I would like fix in the future is the position of the search bar and align it with the categories located on the nav bar. Check it out [`here`](https://antonio98s.github.io/ecommerce-site/)
