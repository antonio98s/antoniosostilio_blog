excerpt: Recordly is an app that records meetings for users.
---
## Objective

Recordly is an app for people to recording meetings, lectures, conversations, etc.

## Process

I learned about this idea by using the Voice Memos app on my iPhone. I wanted to design an alternative option for users to create more choice and competition.

I created a prototype using Figma and designed several frames to demonstrate the logic of the app. The first frame in the demo shows a list of recording made by a user. Sliding the recordings to the left lets the user delete the recording.Pressing the plus button will allow the user to record.

## Results

By completing this project, I learned more about how Figma works as well as designing a mobile app called Recordly in order for users to record their meetings.[`here`](https://www.figma.com/proto/CAEpf6sWLWJ6HLgAZ6vI0T/meeting?node-id=126%3A0&scaling=scale-down)
